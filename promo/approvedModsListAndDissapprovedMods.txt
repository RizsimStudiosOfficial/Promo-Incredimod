MODS THAT ARE APPROVED SINCE I WORKED ON THEM!
1. Thomasbox (Thomas Witt & Rizsim Studios) : Worked on it
2. Terroritum (M.T Team / Asb0's Mainline Mod) : Helped with the code! - Made graphic for polos in-game in havoc (reused in destruction as well and modbox thing too soon)
3. Decay (Puglord71 & LucidLibrarian) : Helped making the custom polo graphic in-game!
4. Foreverbox (Joalor64) : Uhhhh fixed some v8 bugs I guess idfk.
5. Spru-what? (Ragil / RagDewann / Mr wheres amogus bonus 2) : Extra code help that failed my ass!

Disapproved ones / Excluded (for good reasons)
BDFI Editon (Eli Garza 3) : Reason is because this man always does some really bad / dumb shit most of the time and mod isnt even that original so wont be included!
Axe Boat Port 1.7 / 1.7.1 (Rizsim Studios & Jasel1923) : Reason is its just a port of axe boat. (not really a original one tbh).
G Music Port (Rizsim Studios) : Reason is its just a port of g music. (not really a original one tbh).
